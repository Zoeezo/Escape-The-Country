'Escape the country' is a text-based story game written in Python. You are playing as a person living in a country torn apart by a civil war. 


You have to manage items, money and a little bit of luck to survive and make it to a safer country, you'll meet lots of people but not everyone is as they appear.

## About
This is my first school assignment for my software developer course at Mediacollege Amsterdam.

My assignment was to make a text-based application in python about a refugee fleeing his country, to discover what it feels like to be a newcomer in a strange environment.

### Timeline
I started by writing the [game engine](https://github.com/Zoeezo/Escape-The-Country/blob/main/src/GameEngine.py).
After that I made a XML flowchart for the story, which you can see [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/9af55a6b-2b59-460f-bf2f-c710f711f793/view#?folder_id=home&browser=icon).
Then I translated the XML flowchart into [python code](https://github.com/Zoeezo/Escape-The-Country/blob/main/src/Game.py).
*And of course then the bug fixing starts!*

### Self reflection
Personally, making this assignment made me realize how much refugees suffer to get to a safer place and then they risk being sent back, it must be very stressful.
